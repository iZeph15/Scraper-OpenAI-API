"Heron’s Key is currently looking for talented new team members to join our community, click here for opportunities.Penrose Harbor at Heron's Key is the proud recipient of the LTC COVID-19 Immunization Champion Award.Heron’s Key senior living community in Gig Harbor, Washington, is a natural extension of the active Northwest lifestyle you love.  It’s a resident-first, maintenance-free approach that lets you focus on the things you want to do rather than the things you have to do. Plus, as the only community in the area offering true Life Care, Heron’s Key assures you unlimited lifetime access to exceptional on-site care at predictable costs.From the farm and sea to your table.See what residents love about Heron’s Key.Find a layout to complement your lifestyle.Join us virtually to learn more about Heron’s Key.At Heron’s Key, you’ll be surrounded by like-minded neighbors who share your enthusiasm for an active, social retirement. Plus, our excellent location puts you in the perfect position to enjoy the many activities and opportunities on the Key Peninsula.View our floor plans and pricing to find a layout that fits your lifestyle.Located on the Heron’s Key campus, Penrose Harbor offers the area’s most progressive concept in personalized care. The innovative home-like design features all-private suites with private baths. Penrose Harbor provides the full continuum of care, from Assisted Living to Memory Care, Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation.I am so thankful that I found Penrose Harbor. 

During my search for an assisted living community, I wrote a list of what I knew was important to my dad on a day-to-day basis; as well as what I knew would be important in the future. Penrose Harbor’s staff, their philosophy of care, the extremely well thought out apartments and beautiful grounds, as well as the up-front presentation costs, were a perfect fit.

I’m impressed with the helpfulness and responsiveness of the Penrose Harbor staff and it has been a huge relief to know that my dad is well cared for.While we have lived at Heron’s Key for only a short time, we could not be happier with our decision. It is a welcoming and vibrant senior community with something to offer to everyone. The staff is professional, friendly and dedicated to the wellbeing of all residents. It is a great place to live.Penrose Harbor has been a godsend for our family. My grandmother is 98 years old and until a year ago lived independently. I’m a 35-year-old mother of two young children and the only relative that has been able to help with my grandmother's care. I was lost. I toured several facilities before we chose Penrose Harbor and I cannot tell you how happy I am we did. They have gone above and beyond our expectations. They communicate with us on a regular basis, they listen and you can tell every single staff member truly cares about their residents and their families. I am so incredibly thankful for every single staff member. They’ll never truly understand how much their help has meant to me and my family. We've just passed our second-year anniversary of being here at Heron's Key. We are so pleased we made this move when we did as we were in control of the downsizing decisions and now we are thoroughly enjoying the gracious lifestyle, wonderful food, and fulfilling activities Heron's Key offers. Our home is lovely, our neighbors are kind-hearted and everyone has interesting life stories! Living at Heron's Key gives us peace of mind.We moved into Heron's Key in the fall of 2017 and are glad we made the decision to join this engaged Senior Community. From inspiring Lifelong Learning courses, daily exercise opportunities from Tai Chi to weight lifting (organized through Zoom despite Covid), and a wide variety of internal and external voluntary outreach activities, we've found ourselves busier than we ever expected. Becoming part of a senior living community a bit earlier in life (late 60's) we highly recommend making this difficult decision and move sooner rather than later as we've found it easy to make friends and become part of the community that will be part of the rest of our lives.We have lived in Heron's Key from its inception. We are thankful every day that we made that choice. The best thing about living here is the sense of community. Interesting people live here and it is fun to learn about their lives. Our neighbors are supportive and encouraging people. The apartments are beautiful and well planned. Another huge plus, being a foodie, is that the food in the 2 dining rooms is wonderful. They are constantly trying new dishes. The HK staff is likewise exceptional. They are engaged and engaging people who work hard at making this the place we love to call home.Everyone on our staff is and has been doing a GREAT job. It gives me such a warm feeling when I see a staff member and get such cheery greetings. Getting updated on COVID information has been wonderful, so we know what's going on around us. I am so impressed by how well we are all being taken care of. Each resident I have spoken with feels well taken care of also. This is a difficult time for everyone, but our staff has certainly risen to the highest level. Thank you for all you do.Heron’s Key became my home in early October 2017. Each expectation has been fulfilled. I love my home, am grateful for the many “family-friends” living here, and have only praise for the entire staff. It’s my home for life.Fill out this form and we’ll be in touch!ΔNon-Discrimination Policy | Español | tiếng Việt | Tagalog | Polskie | Hrvatski | हिंदी | Deutsch | Français | русский | 中文 | 한국어EnterpriseSenior Living in Gig Harbor, Washington"
